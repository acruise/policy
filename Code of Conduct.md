# Code of Conduct & Grievance Procedure


## CODE OF CONDUCT


### Intention
Vancouver Hack Space Society (VHS) is an inclusive community where all our visitors (both members and guests alike) should feel welcome. This code applies to everyone’s conduct on all VHS-related communication channels (such as IRC, Slack, Talk/mailing lists, etc.), as well as in the physical space itself.

This code of conduct is in addition to the Principles of Unity and other rules, which cover safety and the ethos of the space.

- 1. It is unacceptable to harass or discriminate against others for any reason.
- 2. Keep all communication civil and keep swearing to a minimum; if you can’t make a comment politely and persuasively, don’t make it at all. Your conduct reflects on the image of the VHS as seen by outsiders.
- 3. Trolling is never appropriate.
- 4. Personal attacks will not be tolerated.

If you ignore these guidelines you will initially be warned or moderated. Subsequent offences may result in you being banned from the communications channels. Additionally, the board of directors may start proceedings under the Grievance Procedure.

If you witness any persistent breaches of this code, or have any other concerns, please contact the board of directors. The directors are powerless to fix problems they aren’t aware of.


## GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE


### Intention
The board of directors (BoD) has the authority to ban anyone from entering the space, and to strip anyone of their membership, but must only do so in circumstances where this is best for the Vancouver Hack Space Society (VHS) as a whole.

We will only ban repeat offenders who persistently demonstrate unwillingness to cooperate. Throughout the process every effort will be made to keep clear and constructive communication between the BoD, the offending party, and any other affected parties.

- 1. **Introduction**
  - 1.1 This policy applies to both members and non-members who use VHS.
  - 1.2 A person may be banned from the space if they are in violation of VHS rules or Code of Conduct, if they are causing persistent annoyance, or if they have the potential to harm other users of the space.
  - 1.3 Before the formal banning procedure is entered into, the BoD must make every attempt to resolve the issue informally.
  - 1.4 However, in the case of direct physical violence towards any person in the space, a member has the authority to immediately ban the offender for one month and refer the case to the BoD.
- 2. **Process**
  - 2.1 The BoD investigates complaints and determines the validity of the complaint and determines whether the described behaviour is in violation of VHS rules or Code of Conduct.
  - 2.2 The offending party must be given at least two official warnings before being banned. At every stage, it must be made clear to the party where they are in this process.
  - 2.3 At every stage, it must be the decision of the BoD that allowing the user to continue to use the space would not be in the best interest of the organisation.
  - 2.4 At every stage, the BoD must make their reasoning available to the offending party. They must also make as much detail as is appropriate available to the membership.
  - 2.5 By default, a ban will be for a year. At their discretion, the BoD can issue a reduced ban period.
  - 2.6 Bans of more than one year may only be issued in extreme circumstances. The BoD must review these bans yearly.
  - 2.7 If the offending party is a member, the ban will trigger the process to remove the member according to Article 2.6.2 of the VHS by-laws.
  - 2.8 When a person is banned, their right to access VHS facilities and resources is revoked. Any entry to the space without the prior, express permission of the BoD will be considered trespass.
  - 2.9 The BoD must seek feedback from the membership to ensure this process remains fair, timely and balanced.
