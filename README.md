# policy
Vancouver Hack Space Society organizational policy

Branches:
- master - single source of truth for active organizational policy
- `proposals` - an integrated set of proposed policies and changes. These should be merged to master as a Pull Request created at General Meetings.

Workflow:
1. clone repo
2. create a branch off of `proposals`. Name it something relevant to your changes.
3. push your branch to the origin
4. create a pull request from your branch to `proposals`
5. add reviewers to your pull request, commit ammendments as necessary
6. At a General Meeting, **Squash Merge** proposal branches to `proposals`
7. At the end of the General Meeting, create a single pull request from `proposals` to master and **Merge**

Until further notice there is no particular format to policy but please be concise and consistent. Follow the example of existing policy for format.
